If your intention is to repay even some portion of the help you receive from your parents, structuring a family down payment loan ensures your family member is protected from IRS scrutiny and complications resulting from a potential divorce.

                  Typical rent-to-own contracts have a bad reputation. Typically, a large upfront fee and excessively high rent is paid to really pressure the resident into buying. Sadly, the reality is that many buyers never exercise their right to buy and all those additional fees go straight to the landlordâ€™s pocket. We donâ€™t think thatâ€™s fair.
